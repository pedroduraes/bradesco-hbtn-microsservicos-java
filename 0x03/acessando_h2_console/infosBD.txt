Adding Database Drivers
Additional database drivers can be registered by adding the Jar file location of the driver to the environment variables H2DRIVERS or CLASSPATH. Example (Windows): to add the database driver library C:/Programs/hsqldb/lib/hsqldb.jar, set the environment variable H2DRIVERS to C:/Programs/hsqldb/lib/hsqldb.jar.
